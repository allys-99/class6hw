# This is the pseudocode for 3 features

import the libraries os, numpy, mpl_toolkits.mplot3d, matplotlib.pyplot & pandas

function main
    load the dataset
    get the summary statistics
    plot the graphs

function load the dataset
    read in the file into a dataframe
    manuall add the column headers (as they are not present in the file)

function get summary statistics
    use the dataframe mean function and standard deviation function to
    calculate the mean and standard deviation

function organize the dataset for plotting
    get all rows of the cultivators 1
    get all rows of the cultivators 2
    get all rows of the cultivators 3
    for feature 1
        get the columns of cultivator 1
        get the columns of cultivator 2
        get the columns of cultivator 3
	for feature 2
            get the columns of cultivator 1
            get the columns of cultivator 2
            get the columns of cultivator 3
	    for feature 3
                get the columns of cultivator 1
                get the columns of cultivator 2
                get the columns of cultivator 3
		Plot the 3D figure

function Plot the 3D figure(cultivators 1 2 3 with features 1 2 3)
    reset the index on the tables that were extrated from the dataset
    create the 3D variable
    for cultivator1 and features 1,2,3
        plot a scatter point on the figure
    for cultivator2 and features 1,2,3
        plot a scatter point on the figure
    for cultivator3 and features 1,2,3
        plot a scatter point on the figure
    set the x-axis name
    set the y-axis name
    set the z-axis name
    set the legend
    set the title
    show the figure
    save the figure to a file
