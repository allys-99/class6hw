# This is the pseudocode for 1 A, B, C, E & 2
# Wine dataset

import os, numpy, matplotlib & pandas

function main
    load the wine dataset
    get the summary statistics
    plot the graphs

function load the dataset
   load the wine data into a dataframe, there are no headers
   set the column names in the table
   return the dataframe

function get summary statistics(parameter table)
    use the dataframe function for mean and standard deviation
    to calculate the values for each feature/column

function organize the dataset for plotting(parameter table)
    get all the rows of cultivator 1
    get all the rows of cultivator 2
    get all the rows of cultivator 3
    for a feature1
        get a row from cultivator 1 for this feature1
        get a row from cultivator 2 for this feature1
        get a row from cultivator 3 for this feature1
	for the next feature2
            get a row from cultivator 1 for this feature2
            get a row from cultivator 2 for this feature2
            get a row from cultivator 3 for this feature2
	    plot a graph for the 3 cultivators and 2 features

function draw the scatter plot graph(parameters of cultivators and features)
    set the x-axis name(feature1)
    set the y-axis name(feature2)
    set the title of the graph feature1 vs feature2
    plot a scatter graph of cultivator1 feature1 & feature2 (in color1 marker1)
    plot a scatter graph of cultivator2 feature1 & feature2 (in color2 marker2)
    plot a scatter graph of cultivator3 feature1 & feature2 (in color3 marker3)
    set the legend
    show the graph
    save the graph to a filename
